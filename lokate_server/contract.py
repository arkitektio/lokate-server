"""What this image answers a hub's installer: ``arkitekt-service <verb>`` (see ``arkitekt_service.contract``).

The installer knows the hub; how this release spells its config is written here, with the
settings it is read by. A key renamed in ``configuration.py`` is renamed in :func:`render` in
the same commit, and no installer has to learn of it.
